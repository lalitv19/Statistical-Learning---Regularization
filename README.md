# Statistical-Learning---Regularization
R

This assignemnt was a part of Statistical Learning Module.

Use R for linear regression with least squares on the Boston dataset from
the MASS library and Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors.
Describe for which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis
H0 : j = 0?

Do this using each of the following regularisation approaches:
(i ) no regularisation
(ii ) ridge regression (`2)
(iii ) lasso (`1)
(iv ) elastic net (`1 and `2).

Repeat all of the above on another data set ( North Carolina Data Set)
